# Design and control of 6 Degree of freedom (DOF) Robot manipulator using MATLAB

The Primary objectives of this project are :

1. To compute the homogeneous transformation that relates the wrist frame to the base frame, given the
Denavit-Hartenberg parameters.
2. To compute all possible solutions to the inverse kinematics problem for the manipulator.
3. To compute the Cartesian velocity of the end-effector, given a set of joint velocities and the manipulatorâ€™s
configuration.
4. To compute the inverse dynamics of the manipulator using Newton-Euler algorithm and then compute the
forward dynamics of the manipulator using the torques obtained from the inverse dynamics.
5. To compute the Cubic Polynomial Segments (CPS) and Linear Segments with Parabolic Blends (LSPB) trajectories of the manipulator, given path points.
6. To design a portioned control law for the manipulator that tracks a given trajectory.
